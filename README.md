HOHO - Hope of helping out
Hackathon app


An easy to use messenger chat integrated game app that connects a group of friends and tracks their well being overtime. Friends see each others progress and can talk to ones that need some help. Also, successful group contributions reward friends with points that can be exchanged for vouchers and coupons of their favourite shops - helps to engage in weekly contributions of their lifestyle with no fear of finding out.
To install on Android, iOS, install npm and Ionic Framework with all required dependencies. Then launch build the app using commands found here https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/
